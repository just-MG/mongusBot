# Amogus bot
## Introduction
This is my first bot ever written. It is a bot to automate and simplify our real-life version of the game somewhat resembling *Among Us*.
### Rules of the game
The game is a rather simple one. At the beggining the "Places" and "Players" are inputted. Then all Players get a "kill contract" on other Player in a specific Place. The game is done the way in which all players have different contracts. Only the Player know who they have to kill and they do not know who will try to kill them. In order to kill someone, the killer and the victim need to be alone (that means no other _players_ can be in eyesight, be in the place that is listed as a place of killing of the victimg and the killer needs to say an agreed-upon phrase. For us that was "You are the last straw that broke camel's back". 
**How does the bot work, though?**
In order to use it, you need to understand a few basics commands that allow this bot to run. 
### Bot's prefix is `!`.
- `!plc` - load a specific place into the list of places. Use `!plc` and a single argument e.g. `!plc school`
- `!ppl` - use to initiate the game with specific users. Used as follows: `!ppl @<personOne> @<personTwo @<etc>`
- `!show` - shows the current list of places and players to the admin. 
- `!clear` - admin can clear all the lists that have been initialized.
- `!purge` - admin can purge a whole channel using the bot.
