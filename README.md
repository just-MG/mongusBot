# Amogus bot
## Introduction
This is my first bot ever written. It is a bot to automate and simplify our real-life version of Among Us. In order to use it, you need to understand a few basics commands that allow this bot to run. 
### Bot's prefix is `!`.
- `!plc` - load a specific place into the list of places. Use `!plc` and a single argument e.g. `!plc school`
- `!ppl` - use to initiate the game with specific users. Used as follows: `!ppl @<personOne> @<personTwo @<etc>`
- `!show` - shows the current list of places and players to the admin. 
- `!clear` - admin can clear all the lists that have been initialized.
- `!purge` - admin can purge a whole channel using the bot.
